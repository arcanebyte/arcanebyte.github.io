### Description

Retro is cosmo! The ArcaneByte RS232 WiFiModem is a Hayes-compatible wifi modem for vintage computers with an RS232 serial port that can be used to connect to Internet-based resources.

Now you can connect to your favorite BBS using an IP address rather than a phone number. Or, you can transfer files using zmodem or Kermit @ 1200 baud for that true vintage experience. If you want to host a BBS, enable the TCP/IP listener function to ‘dial in’ to your retro machine. The possibilities really are endless!

The ArcaneByte WiFiModem is a hand-built device and uses modified Zimodem firmware by Bo Zimmerman (available on Github). With the Arduino IDE you are free to install any firmware you see fit. The device is powered by a MicroUSB cable and requires 5V to operate. Connect the WiFiModem directly to your DB25 serial port, or use a straight-through extension cable and/or DB9 adapter and/or gender changer, if necessary. Supports common baud rates (300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200+).

Please note there are two variants of this product. Choose 'male' or 'female' connector at checkout.
