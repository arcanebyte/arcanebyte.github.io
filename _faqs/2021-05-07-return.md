title: How do I return my product?
---

All products we sell are handmade and tested prior to shipping, but sometimes things happen. ArcaneByte offers a 30-day return window, no questions asked. All we ask is that you pay return shipping and return in the item in 'like' condition. We reserve the right to refuse returns if the item is damaged in any way. Please [contact us](/contact/) for an RMA.
