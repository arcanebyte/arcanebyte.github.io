### Description

The **Apple Parallel Port Hard Drive Emulator** faithfully emulates the [Apple ProFile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_ProFile) series of hard disk drives introduced in 1981 for the Apple /// Computer and later the Apple Lisa and Macintosh XL. With little effort, one can install Lisa Office System, MacWorks, SOS, and other operating systems for the Apple Lisa, Macintosh XL, and Apple ///.

Tom Stepleton, who designed the Cameo/Aphid cape for the PocketBeagle and the associated software, has graciously donated his efforts to the public domain - so feel free to build one yourself! Information about the Cameo, Aphid, and Selector can be found at the following links:

- Cameo: [https://github.com/stepleton/cameo](https://github.com/stepleton/cameo)
- Aphid: [https://github.com/stepleton/cameo/tree/master/aphid](https://github.com/stepleton/cameo)
- Selector: [https://github.com/stepleton/cameo/tree/master/aphid/selector](https://github.com/stepleton/cameo)

The emulator is a Linux-based system that works by presenting a disk image file as an Apple ProFile hard drive to the connected system. It supports 5MB and 10MB "ProFile" disk sizes, as well as ardbitrary sizes for operating systems that support it (i.e. MacWorks).
